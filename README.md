# NeuralNetworkTraining
In a neural network, all Neurons of a given Layer are generating an Output, but they donâ€™t have the same Weight for the next Neurons Layer. This means that if a Neuron on a layer observes a given pattern it might mean less for the overall picture and will be partially or completely muted. This is what we call Weighting: a big weight means that the Input is important and of course a small weight means that we should ignore it. Weights will be adjusted over the training to fit the objectives we have set. In simple terms: Training a Neural Network means finding the appropriate Weights of the Neural Connections.  
I explained the basic algorithm about how to train a neural network. Then I demonstrated how to train a neural network with Python. You are welcome to provide your comments and subscribe to my YouTube channel.
